Probabilistic modeling for detecting RNA modifications using nanopore raw signals

A proof-of-concept Bayesian model to de novo detect RNA modifications at single-base and single-molecule resolutions with ONT current-level data in one sample. It is tested on one of the RMAP challenge 2023 datasets.
